# adlumix-branding

Only use logos that are posted to this repo/ **DO NOT** create your own.

Whenever possible, use the SVG file since this is losslessly scalable.

When necessary, use the PNG (transparent background) or JPG (solid).

**DO NOT** create recolored logos, or logos with background colors.

If you need a new logo, talk to Chris.
